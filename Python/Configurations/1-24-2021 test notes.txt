ignore this, old: 1.05 lbs of ullage

correct: 2.675 lbs of ullage

1st test: PID cosntants were 5 3 3. this was incorrect, should have been 5 2 3 (P I D), will do for 2nd test

total wheight flowed 5.919 lbs

motor seemed to be 150 degs to far opened after running a test where it was fully open then fully closed

2nd test: PID cosntants 5 2 3
1.075 lbs of ullage
add 1.25 lbs to the ullage
motor set position immediately went to max, causing motor to open to far and vent valve went off, went to manual during test


for test 1 and 2, there was a bug in the firmware that caused the motor set position to go to the max value. this bug was fixed after the 2nd test

Jefferson Vent solenoid was not working because valve channel 2 was not working, pending further investigation, was likely a press board hardware issue

3rd test: same pid constants, control loop worked, test was terminated early because the hose fell off and threatened to get water on avionics. looked like mostly bang bang

4th test: same pid constatns, control loop worked, ran test for full 8 seconds. started motor a bit open (7 degrees) the motor barely moved during this test and bang bang control of the control valve seemed to be sufficient to maintain tank pressure.

set pressure of 40psi for all tests.

for all tests, motor zero positon was likely a bit greater than the actual zero position, as it was zeroed visually

100 Hz control calcs for all tests
