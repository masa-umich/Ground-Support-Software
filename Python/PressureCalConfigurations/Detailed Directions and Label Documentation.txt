Sensor Calibrations Instructions

 - Load in previously saved calibration files using the "Load" button in the top right of the window.
 - Input calibration values manually by typing values into the input fields for each channel
 - Use the selection box at the right of each channel to switch between voltage/pressure inputs
and slope/offset inputs depending on the board being used.
 - The save button will send the unsaved values to the board and the save the configuration if a file
is selected.
 - If no file is previously selected to save the configuration, a save dialog will open allowing the
user to choose a configuration or save a new one.
 - The save as button will bring up the save dialog if the user wishes to change the configuration to
save to.

Notes:
 - If no channel is edited, the save as button will not "work" because there is nothing to save.
 - To save an entire configuration, the user must "edit" all of the channels they wish to
save. This can be tedious, but should allow the user to choose which channels they wish to save to the
configuration.

Error Labels:
 - Not Saved: label that appears when an input field within a channel has been edited. This tells
the user that the field has been changed and that they must send a command to project their
change to the board.
 - Failed To Save: label that appears when a channel has not been saved to the board. This 
error will most likely occur when an input field does not contain a value. Raises error in command
line.
 - At Least 1 Channel Failed to Save: label that appears at the top of the window that tells the user
that at least one channel did not save correctly.
 - At Least 1 Channel Failed to Load!! Check that File has float-point numbers: label that appears
at the top of the window that tells the user that at least one channel did not load correctly. Look
over the channels in the window to find the one that didn’t load correctly. This error can occur 
when the .json configuration file is edited outside of the GUI. The actual error is that at least one 
field in the channel is not a float-point number – most likely a string or an integer. Find the
configuration file and edit the .json file.
 - At Least One Channel's Slope/Offset Values are Different From Board's: label that appears at the
window that tells the user when a channel’s values are different the ones currently loaded on the board.
If no board is connected, this label will always be shown because the default “fake board” values are
zeros.
